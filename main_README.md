# Dynamic Modeling Examples (Python)

This repository contains a small collection of dynamic (ODE-based) models implemented in Python.

## Contents
1. `1_logistic_growth/` – Logistic growth with parameter estimation  
2. `2_infection_dynamics/` – Simple host–pathogen interaction model  
3. `3_enzyme_kinetics/` – Enzyme kinetics based on E+S <-> ES -> E+P

These examples were developed as part of my preparation for research in computational biology (MBG-CSIC, Pontevedra).
