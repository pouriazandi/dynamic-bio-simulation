# Logistic Growth Model

This folder contains a simple ODE-based model for microbial/cell growth.
The model:
- defines a logistic differential equation,
- generates synthetic experimental data,
- fits model parameters using least-squares,
- and visualizes the results.

To run:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
python logistic_model.py
